		    <h2><b>FAQ</b></h3>
			<h3>What does this website do?</h3>
			<p>This website has an interactive map of the University of Washington, Bothell campus. Using the map, you can find classrooms, look at building layouts, find out where your class is located and see detailed information about special rooms like computer labs, dining areas and offices.</p>
        	<h3>Who created this?</h3>
			<p> This website and map application were created by Husky Solutions, a team of students at the University of Washington, Bothell.</p>
			<h3>What do all the buttons above the map do?</h3>
			<p>In the upper left-hand corner of the map is the drop-down menu. This menu lists all the buildings that we have layouts of. Clicking on a building in the dropdown menu will take you to the ground floor of each building. In the upper right-hand corner of the map is the search bar. You can type in a building, like UW1, a facility, like the library, or a classroom. When searching for a classroom, you must put a space or a hyphen between the building and the room number. So UW1-121 and UW1 121 both work, but UW1121 will not.  If you click the Husky logo between those two buttons, it will take you to the main campus map.</p>
			<h3>How do I look at a building layout?</h3>
			<p>There are three ways to look at the layouts of a building. You can click the building on the campus map, select the building from the dropdown menu in the upper left of the map, or type in the name of building into the search bar.</p>
			<h3>How do I change floors in a building?</h3>
			<p>There are buttons below each floor layout listing the number of floors. The floor you’re currently on should be selected. Click the circle next to the floor you want to go to.</p>
			<h3>How do I find a classroom?</h3>
			<p>There are two ways to find a classroom. You can either start by going to the building the classroom is in and finding the floor it’s on or search for the classroom using the search bar. If you search for it in the search bar, the classroom location will be highlighted.</p>
			<h3>How do I find out where my class is located?</h3>
			<p>If you know the classroom number, you can search by that using the search bar. Otherwise, you can type your class number into the search bar. If there are multiple sections, a prompt will ask you to pick which one is yours. Then the map will take you to the appropriate building and floor, where your classroom will be highlighted.</p>
			<h3>How do I get back to the campus map?</h3>
			<p>There are two ways to get back to the campus map. If you click the Husky logo between those two buttons, it will take you to the main campus map. You can also select the campus map from the drop-down menu.</p>
			<h3>What kinds of information can I see when I click on a room?</h3>
			<p>When you click on a room, a pop-up window appears to display information. It will indicate the type of room (classroom, office, computer lab, etc), list the titles and hours of any classes that use that room and, if the room is a special use room (administrative office, computer lab, food, etc), a link to their website will also be included.</p>
			<h3>How do I find hours for the library/lab/food place, etc?</h3>
			<p>Find the appropriate room and click on it. A pop-up window will display information about the room and if it’s a place that has hours, such as the library, the window will contain a link to the facility’s website for more information, including hours.</p>
